## Topic: Software Development

## Question:
 What is the impact of machine learning/artificial intelligence (AI) on consumers and enterprise? What language is best suited for machine learning application development? How can we use AI/machine learning to address IC design challenges?

## Essay:
“Artificial Intelligence is the new electricity”[1], said Andrew Ng - AI professor at Stanford - about the impact of AI on the future of businesses. One of the earliest field that applied AI in development is Integrated Chip (IC) design, but that application is only the tip of the iceberg. Currently no language can beat Python on developing AI/ML applications.

In public perception, AI is something advanced that only exist in sci-fi, because as soon as AI can do a task, it ceases to be labelled as AI. Recent progresses in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision have allowed human to interact with computer in a more human way. Auto face recognition in photos or having conversations with virtual assistant are examples of AI product that are already widely available. Those new experiences in human-machine interaction have challenged that old perception of the public and raise awareness about AI’s rapid advancement.

On the other end of business spectrum, AI will continue to play a large role in enterprise’s decision making procedure. Data is the new oil that fuels ML to transform every single industry. Companies are collecting more and more data but without ML it is hard to gain any meaningful insights from this massive ocean of data. Building AI/ML system that can analyze milion of data points will help optimize business’ operations or explore and deploy new functionalities to market. Google recently used DeepMind AI to cut down 40% of the electricity bill uses to cool its data center is a great example of AI’s optimization.[2] It is clear that enterprises that quickly apply AI in its operation will have a huge advantage over competitors.

In the challenges of IC design, a lot of traditional AI techniques have been used to design computer chip such as finding shortest path in wire routing or formal verification. With a vast amount of data and variables such as chip power, performance, temperature, etc., ML has been successfully applied in various tasks of Electronic Design Automation software. Anomaly detection, usage prediction in IC design are some possible direction to apply AI/ML in IC design.

Python is currently the most popular language for developing AI and ML application.[3] AI researchers like Python because of simple syntax that’s almost like pseudocode while AI engineers like Python for its supportive community and high quality libraries. The race now is not between languages but rather between ML/DL frameworks such as PyTorch, Tensorflow, Keras, etc. In addition to Python, when it comes to deployment, C++ is also well supported in many frameworks because of its speed and reliability.

In conclusion, ML and AI are projected to transform every industry and bring drastic changes to both consumers and enterprises. With the ability of learning from data in high dimensional problem space, ML is a proper solution to many problems, including in IC design. Developing AI is complicated and contains many layers of abstraction, so Python is growing fast in AI community thank to its simplicity.
