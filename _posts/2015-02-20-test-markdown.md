title: Implement your own ML algorithm: Linear Regression
subtitle: Learn to implement Machine Learning algorithm from scratch

In this tutorial, together we will implement our first Machine Learning algorithm, **Linear Regression** using only _numpy_ for mathematical calculation and _matplotlib_ for visualization

# What is _Linear Regression_?
From the independent variables _X_ with _m_ training examples, we have the corressponding dependent variables _y_. In _Linear Regression_, we try to find the linear correlation between _X_ and _y_, that is to best fit a straight line into the given data then using that line to predict the value _y_ of unseen _X_.  
The function that describes our straight line which was fitted into our data is called the **hypothesis function**. Assumming our data has a straight line that perfectly fit to every training examples of the data, the goal of our ML algorithm is to make the **hypothesis function** similar to the perfect function as much as possible.

# Cost Function
In order to make our **hypothesis function** similar to the perfect function, that is make our **hypothesis function**

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
